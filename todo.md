Target June 19th

Suggested by Lyssa:

- should be able to hover over appointments on the schedule to see basic details about the appointment
- when creating or editing an appointment, you should be able to override to select any technician for the appointment, even if they are not recommended, and see warnings about potential issues
- on sheet one, hover card to see client details when hovering over a scheduled block
- remaining sheet one matrix showing how many times a particular client has been scheduled with a technician
- legend on sheet one

Requested by Alycen and Amy:

- add for all days "repeats"
  - can only select days that are not already scheduled at that time
- add a read only role
  - BCBAs can see the full schedule but not edit it
- add "currently onboarding" field to the client
  - when checked, their appointments on sheet 1 should be yellow instead of green
- text color as well as background color for techs
- warning about max hours per day for techs
  - set max hours per day when adding/updating a tech
- basic scheduling of OT and speech
  - they're fine with this being very simple. All this needs to do is let you put in appointments that are not tied to a tech, and select
    whether it is OT or speech. It will show up differently on the schedule, and not at all on sheet 1.
- sub list
  - when setting a tech's availability, you need to be able to indicate if this is a regular availability, or available for sub
  - new page to see all subs
  - on sheet one, show sub availability as solid blue
- additional table on the schedule page:
  - tech name | blocks for the day | total hours | requested hours

Other:

- Need to indicate on the availability blocks if the appointment is in clinic, and if it is not the full block
- Display warning if client is not available for in clinic and it is checked

Done:

- Allow manually setting the start and end time of an appointment
- Indicate that an appointment is in clinic on the schedule
- Indicate that an appointment is in clinic on sheet 1
- Allow manually setting the start and end time of an availability
- Create custom time input component that only allows 15 minute intervals between a min and max value
- Add ability to to set "in clinic" for client availability
- Add warning about creating split blocks for techs or clients
- Add confirmation when deleting an availability
- Add ability to edit appointments, including recalculating warnings
- Add confirmation when deleting an appointment
