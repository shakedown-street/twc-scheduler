Target June 19th

My suggestions:

- Create custom time input component that only allows 15 minute intervals, and can have a min/max value
- Need to indicate on the availability blocks if the appointment is in clinic, and if it is not the full block

Suggested by Lyssa:

- on _client_ availability, you should be able to indicate that the client is available for in clinic
- should be able to hover over appointments on the schedule to see details about the appointment
- clicking an appointment on the schedule should open the appointment details and allow you to edit or delete the appointment
- when creating or editing an appointment, you should be able to override to select any technician for the appointment, even if they are not recommended, and see warnings about potential issues
- on sheet one, hover card to see client details when hovering over a scheduled block
- remaining sheet one matrix showing how many times a particular client has been scheduled with a technician
- legend on sheet one

Requested by Alycen and Amy:

- add for all days "repeats"
- are you sure you want to remove this availability
- add a read only role
- add "currently onboarding" field to the client
- text color as well as background color for techs
- max hours per day for techs
- warning about split blocks
- basic scheduling of OT and speech
- sub list

Additional info on the schedule:

- tech name | blocks for the day | total hours | requested hours

Done:

- Allow manually setting the start and end time of an appointment
- Indicate that an appointment is in clinic on the schedule
- Indicate that an appointment is in clinic on sheet 1
- Allow manually setting the start and end time of an availability
